In unordered list(ul) in CSS I used list-style-type: none; to get rid of dot in list item(li).
In list item(li)I used 
display: flex and align-items: center to center text vertically, 
height: 50px to increase height of item for picture, 
padding-left: 30px; to move text out of background img,
background-position: left; to center pisture by vertically,
background-image: url(Flag_of_Ukraine.png) to add picture at the background, 
background-repeat: no-repeat to turned off repetition of img.

*NOTE*
We made illusion of list item img by adding background img and changing it. This isn't good answer how center img but good alternative!
